This repository contains the Julia code used to simulate the 4 models. The code is written with Jupyter notebooks.
The code runs with Julia 1.1.

`core_fun.ipynb` is the notebook containing the main routines for the four cases studied in the paper. It is commented with the equations of the model.

### How to run the code
`core_fun.ipynb` is called with the `NBInclude` package in each of the four cases studied.
